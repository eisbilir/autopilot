This command line provides 2 functionalites:
 - run once (given a list of project ids or retrieve ids from AutoPilotSource)
 - poll mode (scheduled in background to run Auto Pilot every some intervals)

 The command line syntax is:
 java AutoPilotUtility (-poll [interval] | -project [Id[, ...]])

    - poll and project These next options are mutually exclusive (to indicate
        two kinds of run-mode): It is an error if both poll/projects are
        specified or none are specified.

    A) Poll-mode - poll is used to define the interval in minutes, if interval
        is not specified, a default of 1 minute is used. The autopilot job will
        be executed every this interval starting from midnight.

    B) - project can be specified to process projects with the given ids. The
        project ids will be processed once and the application terminates, it
        doesn't go into poll mode. If no ids are given, AutoPilotSource is
        used instead.
